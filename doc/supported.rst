Supported data formats
======================

As of InsarViz 1.0.0, supported input data format only include:

* NSBAS-type time series (depl_cumule and associated files)
* GeoTiffs

We are developping on a mechanism to allow users to provide a **plug-in-type loader to load other types of data**. Saty tuned!
