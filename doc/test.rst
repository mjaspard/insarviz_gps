Running all the tests
---------------------

Testing can be done classically using *unittest*:


.. code-block :: bash
    
        python setup.py test


Another way of running test is by running *pytest*. Navigate to the main insarviz folder, and run the test with the following command: 

.. code-block :: bash
    
        pytest
